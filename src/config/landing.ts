      "I worked with Dustin over a 2.5 year timeframe in two different organizations. He was the evaluated as the best leader in both organizations and ranked #1 of 30+ peers. He is a highly driven, intelligent, morally principled, leader of peers. He delivers candid feedback, with insightful and comprehensive analysis. He communicates complex problems clearly and can serve as the face and lead of any project or organization. He is both professional and personable, able to be highly effective in diverse environments and workplaces. He will be an invaluable asset to your organization and comes with my highest possible recommendation.      ",

      "Dustin is the real deal. Throughout his Capstone project, he showed a remarkable market sense and marketing instincts in the context of building & scaling a platform company. Equally as impressive were his Project Management skills, which I attribute to his leadership ability & tremendous work ethic. Put another way, he took charge from Day 1 and ran a very tight ship. I've taught thousands of talented students and if I were starting a company tomorrow, Dustin would be on a VERY short list of those I'd try to recruit.",

      "I had the pleasure of working with Dustin while he was an Account Executive on my team back in 2020. I was consistently impressed with Dustin's executive level communication which enabled him to earn the respect and trust of his clients extremely quickly. In addition to building great relationships, his strong business acumen enabled him to connect the dotsby mapping Gartner's capabilities to our clients challenges. The result was that his C-Level executives were consistently some of our most engaged and satisfied clients. Dustin, working with you was an honor I have no doubt you will succeed in your career.",
